Replace YOUR SERVER URL HERE (PLEX.DOMAIN.COM) with your own server under var server
Replace "YOUR PLEX GUI, ETC" with a URL to your own server 
Replace YOUR NETDATA HOST with your NetData instance under data-host

This is a fork of https://github.com/ITRav4/PlexRedirect I just added netdata and did some tweaks for my own usage.
