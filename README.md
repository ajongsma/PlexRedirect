![alt tag](https://i.imgur.com/ML30ZKQ.png)

## Features:
* Link to Plex.tv
* Link to PlexRequests
* Link to PlexPy
* Shows Plex status (online or offline) using [ping.js](https://github.com/alfg/ping.js)

Replace YOUR SERVER URL HERE (PLEX.DOMAIN.COM) with your own server under var server
Replace "YOUR PLEX GUI, ETC" with a URL to your own server 
Replace YOUR NETDATA HOST with your NetData instance under data-host

You can find all the charts available at your netdata server with this URL:
http://localhost:19999/api/v1/charts

This is a fork of https://github.com/ITRav4/PlexRedirect I just added netdata and did some tweaks for my own usage.
